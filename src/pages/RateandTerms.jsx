                <span>
                  The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for loans is determined by
                  several factors, including:
                </span>
                <p className="light_color">
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Interest Rate: The base interest rate charged by the
                      lender on the loan amount.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Loan Term: The length of time over which the loan will be
                      repaid. Longer terms may have different rates.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Fees and Charges: Any additional fees, such as origination
                      fees, processing fees, or other charges that may apply to
                      the loan.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Credit Score: The borrower's credit score and credit
                      history, which can influence the interest rate offered by
                      the lender.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Loan Amount: The total amount of the loan, as higher loan
                      amounts might have different rate structures.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Market Conditions: Prevailing economic and market
                      conditions can impact the interest rates offered by
                      lenders.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p className="mt6">
                  The APR is a comprehensive measure that includes both the
                  interest rate and any additional fees or charges, providing a
                  more accurate reflection of the total cost of the loan on an
                  annual basis. This allows borrowers to compare different loan
                  offers more effectively.
